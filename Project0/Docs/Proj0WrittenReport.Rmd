## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Outline  - should total 4-6 pages double spaced 

Introduction: Briefly describe project including data received by investigator and scientific hypothesis of interest. Rephrase scientific hypothesis of interest into testable statistical hypothesis. (~1/2 page)
Give info pertinent to data analysis – not general biology background

Methods: Describe methods used to clean and analyze the data. Justify and explain analysis approach ( ~2 pages). Written in past tense. Do not include results or equataions

look at group sizes and demographics (mean age, etc. for each treatment group)

Results: Present Results for analyses described in methods (~1 – 1.5 pages)  Use tables and figures as appropriate. Include in text the full interpretation of the statistical results for the main findings (point estimates, confidence bounds, p-values, interpretation of results of test)
Tables and figures don’t count towards page limit and should be limited to a total of 6

Conclusions: (~0.5 – 1 page) interpret results in context of scientific questions. Discuss any limitations to your analysis that may affect your interpretation or that require additional consideration by investigator

talk about missing data and the missingness primarily in group 5 – leading to smaller sample size  and missingness wasn’t address, why did missing occur? likely not random?
