# BIOS6623Class

This folder contains the project materials for BIOS6623 minus datasets.  The datasets are not in this repository because you never know when data contains sensitive information. So, we want to minimize the risk that data could be accidentally shared. We have created folder templates for all projects. These provide one way of organizing work in an common framework.

For this class, the datasets can be found on CANVAS.

This is the readme.md file in the repository for Michaela Palumbo. 
I'm doing the MS in biostatistics and this is my second year. I went to CU Boulder for my undergrad.

I am editing this file in R markdown. I'm not sure that I am opening the files to edit them correctly. 
I right clicked on the readme.md file that I saw in GitKraken and then chose open file and it opened in R markdown which is where I'm typing now. Before I opened the file I pressed the pull button. 

I don't know if this is a general readme file for our entire repository and all the work we do in this class. It seems like we should have a readme file for each project we work on. Not sure if that is something that we will create or that we need to create on our own so I will ask that in class on Wednesday.
