Project 1 Working Summary

Loaded the data and began to clean through it. Change coding for missing values. Dropped data for all time points except for baseline and year 2. Changed to wide format. Changed coding and levels for some of the categorical variables specified by ivnestigator. 

Next time I pick up:
Once figure out about the "based on trajectory"" cat variables potentially recode levels for those.
Change all categorical variables to factors instead of numeric.
Create datasets specific to each of the 4 outcomes.
Ex: For AGG_MENT drop all subjects who are missing this measure at 0 or baseline and then create a difference variable for the outcome
Question: Should I do this approach or should I just drop from dataset anyone who is missing any of the outcome variables and have one big data set?
What should I do my descriptives on?
Should I do them separately for each outcome?

Start working on descriptive stats and plots and tables and checking model assumptions

Start running models and model selection process

Run final models and interpret results
