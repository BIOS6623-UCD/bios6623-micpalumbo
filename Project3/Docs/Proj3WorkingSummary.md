Project 3 Working Summary:

To-do for interim:
Subset data to groups for analysis for each outcome
Figure out sample size (# subjects and # observations for each analytic dataset)
Plot trajectories for each of the 4 outcome (plot for all subjects, stratify by gender, stratify by whether they developed MCI)
Make analysis plan to answer the research questions (what types of models I'll do)
Read change point analysis paper
Figure out which covariates to use (include age, gender, and SES, age at onset?
Make presentation slides
Compile list of questions for investigators:
  - Should cdr be categorized or left continuous?
  - Distribution of logmemII looks kinda weird - ask investigators for normal range, why there might      be lots of lower values/bimodal appearance?
