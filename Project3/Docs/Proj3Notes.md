BIOS 6623 Project 3 Notes (from in class and communications with investigators and peers):

November 6, 2017:
Two time periods going on:
1. Know these measures decline slightly as you age
2. Asking if there is some sort of acceleration (comparted to normal aging process) if you're about to be diagnosed with MCI
Big goal = is there a biomarker (one of the 4 outcomes) that can be used to predict diagnosis
Doing different models and analyzing each of the 4 outcomes separately - they are measures for different brain regions so don't expect them to have the same results
