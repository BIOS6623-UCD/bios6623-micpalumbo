BIOS 6623 Project 4 Notes (from in class and communications with investigators and peers):

Notes from the research strategy pdf:
A. Significance:
Inflammation = a normal immune response
Sustained inflammation can disrupt cognition and increase neurodegeneration
Inflammation is now thought to be an early event that potentially contributes to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD)
MCI = intermediate diagnosis between healthy aging and dementia
  - amnestic presentations more prone to future development of AD
  - amnestic presentations with MCI is referred to as amnestic mild congitive impairment (aMCI)
Inflammation is modifiable and can be controlled by therapies/treatments so it is important to understand this process
Older adults with MCI = understudied patient group
*Progression of symptoms in aMCI occurs at variable rate of 5-20% of MCI subjects converting to dementia annually*
Higher levels of inflammatory markers found in MCI patients compared with both controls and AD patients
Goal = examine links between established markers and new markers of peripheral inflammation over time
B. Innovation:
Looking at CNS-derived markers of inflammation rather than just peripheral markers of inflammation
Looking at markers longitudinally rather than previous cross-sectional studies
C. Approach:
Research strategy is longitudinal evaluation (baseline and 1 year) of innate immune system-associate mechanisms of cognitive decline in aMCI (amnestic mild cognitive impairment). 
C.1 (pink highlight)
Aim 1 Description: Evaluate longitudinal associations between markers of peripheral inflmmation, cognition, and brain structure in aMCI. 
Aim 2 Description: Examine how markers of peripheral inflammation impact the relationship between AD pathology and clinical pogression of aMCI. 
*C.2 Preliminary studies (potentially useful info for estimates of effect sizes and std. dev)*
- high levels of peripheral inflammatory markers are related to worse memory and smaller medial temporal lobe structure
    - preliminary data (n=92) show higher levels of Il-6 predict smaller mean cortical thickness in 
      the AD- signature at followup (18-24 month post baseline; *beta = -20.133, se = 9.604*) even   
      after *controlling for total cortical thickness*
- specific chemokines (MCP-1, eotaxin-1) have been linked to hippocampal neurogenesis and worse spatial memory in mice. 
    - In a study examining this in adults (n=122), found increases in MCP-1 over 18 to 24 months 
      predict poorer memory performance at followup *(beta = -0.018, se = 0.009)*, after controlling        for *baseline MCP-1 levels*
          - these increases display *stronger associations* with decline in verbal memory recall over               the same time frame (*controlling for demographics*)
- peripheral chemokine levels found to be related to memory and grey matter volume in aMCI and AD
    - *controlling for demographics, severity level, and APOE genotype* high levels of MCP-1 related          to lower memory scores, and an interaction between chemokines - higher levels of both                 eotaxin-1 and mcp-1 associated with worse verbal and visual memory
    - via MRI studies, higher MCP-1 and Eotaxin-1 levels associated w/ smaller left medial temporal         lobes
- baseline peripheral chemokine levels predict memory decline in patients with aMCI
    - higher Eotaxin-1 levels in aMCI subects (n=40) predict decline in recall on episodic memory           list-learning test over 12 months (*beta = -0.016, se = 0.006*), findings stayed consistent           after *controlling for baseline memory performance, demographics (age, sex), severity level,          APOE status* 
*C.3 Participant Recruitment*
- expect to recruit 2-3 participants/week
- projected 10% dropout over the follow-up period
-*plan to recruit 138 aMCI patients and 56 HC (healthy controls) to reach two-time point goal of 125 aMCI patients & 50 HC subjects*
    - subjects ages 60-90 years
- want to include functionally normal adults in study because think that AD pathology (i.e. inflammation markers) may be present before MCI or AD diagnosis
*C.5 Aim 1 Methods*
- assessment of inflammatory markers:
    - markers previously associated with pathological aging and AD: IL-6, TNF-alpha
    - novel markers of hippocampal neurogenesis: MCP-1, Eotaxin-1
    - beta-2 microglobulin and ACT also measured - strong markers of AD pathology, pathological            aging, and clinical outcomes
- cognitive measures:
    - will assess lots of memory processes and cognitive functioning
    - hypotheses relate to episodic memory function
    - tests of recall/recognition: CVLT (variables = 20' delay, total correct, recognition, D-prime)       & Benson Figure (variables = 15' delay, total correct)
    - tests of pattern separation: MST (variables = proportion correct)
    - long term consolidation: story recall (variables = 1-week delay, total correct)
- MRI (assessing changes in brain structure):
    - cortical thickness: calculated as closest distance from gray/white boundary to gray/CSF bound
    - total intracranial volume (ICV)
        - calculations account for longitudinal measures and correlation between repeated measures on           a subject
    - will examin mean cortical thickness of all the AD cortical signature regions (because there are       a lot of them so won't do thickness for each region individually)
- Expected Outcomes:
    - *hypothesis 1a: higher baseline cytokine and chemokine levels in circulating plasma will               predict declines in memory consolidation and decreases in AD-signature cortical thickness*
    - *hypothesis 1b: greater increases in cytokines and chemokines will be associated with greater         declines in eposiodic memory and cortical thickness*
- Analytical plan (green highlight, what we need to help fill in)
    - Outcomes: decline in memory (change in 1 year) and change in cortical thickness (change over 1       year) 
    - Primary predictors: cytokines and chemokines (i.e. IL-6, TNF-alpha, MCP-1, Eotaxin-1, Beta-2         microgobulin, ACT)
    - Covariates to adjust for: age, sex, others (?), baseline values of outcome(?), BMI?, other           health conditions correlated with inflammation?, previous studies above adjusted for severity        level and APOE status
*C.6 Aim 2 Methods*
- unclear whether inflammation is soley function of aging brain or whether it relates to accumulating disease
- amyloid accumulation presumed to occur decades before initial clinical symptoms, so it is likely inflammatory processses reach their peak levels after this initial pathogenic development 
- will assess blood inflammation (see section 1 of C.5) and memory (see section 2 of C.5) over 2 time points and relate it to amyloid deposition using amyloid PET imaging at baseline
- Expected Outcomes: 
    - hypothesis of interaction between peripheral levels of inflammation and amyloid deposition such     that the presence of both significant amyloid depositon and elveated inflammatory markers will be     the strongest predictors of memory decline and decline in AD signature cortical thickness over 1     year
Analytical Plan (green highlight, what we need to help fill in)
    - Aim 2a outcome: amyloid depositon and coritcal thickness
    - Aim 2a covariates: inflammatory markers, age, sex, other confounders?
    - Aim 2b outcome: clinical progression variables (change in memory)
    - Aim 2b covariates: amyloid deposition (and cortical thickness), inflammatory markers,                other confounders?
          - Aim 2b: Wants to know if inflammatory markers modify the association between amyloid                 depositon (or cortical thickness) and clinical progression
              - *interaction terms?*
*D Power Analysis and Additional Statistical Considerations* (green highlight, help fill in)
- want us to justify the sample size they are proposing they can attain
      - let them know if we do power calculation & want them to recruit more people
- the 2 groups (HC and aMCI patients) will be combined for analysis
- there are a lot of cytokine/chemokines so we are expected to adjust for multiple comparisons

Questions I have for investigators:
4. What is the type of test/analysis we'll be doing for each study aim?
    - this question is more to work through with other collaborating statisticians
5. What is the spread (variance) you typically see in this data? (Range of values)
6. What is the size of the effect that you hope to see/ what is the smallest clinically meaningful   
   difference you hope to be able to detect?
7. What is the outcome?
8. What is the primary predictor?
9. What covariates would you like to include?
10. What is it that you would like to know/what conclusions & interpretations do you want to make for each aim?
14. Clarify what we want to know for aim 2a and aim 2b?
15. How to include covariates of inflammation markers? baseline values or was it collected at both years
16. How to adjust for multiple comparisons/where are the multiple comparisons occurring?
17. Modelling strategry and model selection approach?
18. Is power analysis for linear regression change if have interaction or what covariates you're going to include/ how many covariates?

11/29/17:
They say the sample size they can recruit with their budget and want us to calculate power to either justify or say they need a bigger sample size. 

In our report we will have the analysis plan: the models we plan to run for each aim (crude, adding covariates, etc)

Then will have the power/sample size calculation & justification.
Will have different power analysis for each outcome type (i.e. for each set of models)
