Project 4 Working Summary:

Things I need to know for power and sample/size analysis:

1. Sample size limit or desired power (need to set one or the other)
2. Estimate of variance/standard error (see research strategy pdf section C.2 preliminary studies for potential estimates that can be used in power analysis)
3. Estimate of effect size (see same reference as above) - ask what they expect/hope to see & what would be the smallest clinically meaningful difference they'd like to be able to detect
4. What is the type of test/analysis we will be doing for each study aim

Need to answer these questions by talking with investigator and looking through research strategy. 
Need to figure out how I propose to do a power/sample size analysis using R (never done it before)

Final Report: 1-2 pages, no presentation, drop off in her office (find out where that is)

Aim 1: plan for models/analysis
crude models for outcome includes all covariates you're adjusting for and one of each of the primary predictors (the inflammation markers), then have model with all markers and take one marker out at a time from that model: compare AICs & see if effect sizes change or significance changes in presence of the other markers?
Figure out how to test hypothesis 1a and 1b

Aim 2: plan for models/analysis
