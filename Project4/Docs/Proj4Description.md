Project 4 Description:

The purpose of this project is to develop the analysis and sample size sections for a grant application. The grant provided for this project has been graciously shared by Dr. Brianne Bettcher. Dr. Bettcher is a neuropsychologist and works on Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) and aging. A draft of the grant is provided on canvas. Please do not share this research strategy document with others as it is her actual research grant.

The goal of this research is to understand the relationship between inflammation, AD pathology, and cognitive decline. We have uploaded into canvas the research strategy for this grant application. In that document, we have highlighted in pink the aims and in green areas that need filling in. The green sections have thoughts shared to you from the investigator. They will not provide you with all the information you need to complete this project, but should provide a starting point for further communication.

1) Group 1 will work on an analysis plan and sample size justification for Aim 1 only.

2) Group 2 will work on an analysis plan and sample size justification for Aims 1 and 2.

The write up for this project will be quite different from your previous projects. I suspect you can draft an analysis section and an analysis plan in 1 to 1.5 double spaced pages for Group 1 and 2-pages for group 2.  You should include a Data Analysis section and a Sample size justification.  If you have two aims you can organize the report with two data analysis sections and one sample size section or organize the report by aims. It is your choice.

The investigator (Dr. Bettcher) will come to class on Dec 4th to answer questions.
