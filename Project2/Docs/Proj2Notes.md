Project 2 Class Discussion Notes

Death rates - give a lot 
Want observed estimate just for the most recent 6 months
Use all of previous data just to come up with an expected estimate to compare to the observed estimate
Use BMI instead of height and weight
Check to see if certain crazy values are coming from a particular hospital
BMI potential data entry errors?

In a report want table with the following columns: hospital, observed # died, observed # seen, observed rate, expected rate (all of these for each hospital)
Pool all data across all hospitals (and years) to do this - they are all general VA patient populations
Will have to do a hospital interaction
There should not be time trends
Not Bayesian
Procedure 2 is another non-cardiac procedure so don't want to include people with that
Can report rate as # people who died per 1000 or as a percentage
